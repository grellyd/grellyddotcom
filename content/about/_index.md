Hi I'm Graham. 

@grellyd most places online.

I'm a late twenty-something who likes working on his laptop and adventuring outside. I'm always looking for my next adventure.

If you are looking for my C.V. jump to my [resume](/resume). 

I currently work for [1Password](https://1password.com/) as a Tech Lead on the User Lifecycle & Growth (ULG) team. This means I:
 - Solve hard technical problems
 - Deliver large multi-domain projects on time
 - Translate business requirements into technical requirements
 - Work with product and design to figure out what we should do next
 - Grease the development wheels under my team enabling them to move quickly 
 - Iterate on our Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
 - Look ahead to remove blockers and conflicts before they manifest 
 - Manage and get buy in to pay down our tech debt

My goals in this role are to:
 - Push my technical abilities 
 - Empower and enable my team
 - Build understanding and clarity for the team and leadership on what we are doing and why 
 - Find the “right” solution to problems allowing us to spend time on what matters.

I started working for 1Password in March 2019.

Outside of work my partner and I are avid outdoor people. Hiking and skiing were our bread and butter while in the lower mainland, then scuba diving, hiking, and sea kayaking on Vancouver Island, and now canoeing and cross country skiing in Saskatoon. Our gear room is one of my favourite places to be.

We also have a phenomenal adventure cat that accompanies us on most outings. Peek at [his instagram](https://instagram.com/nicholascbrownie) for a taste of his outdoor preferences!

### Why Grellyd?

Grellyd stems from my first attempt at a screen name combined with a portion of my middle name: **gre**yham **ll**o**yd**. I can happily say that I am the only result one finds when they Google 'grellyd'.

### Why Computer Science?

In short, the feeling of using software to solve problems.

After being struck in my first class by the immense power of programming and a strange sense of freedom, I realised I could experiment and try to solve problems without 'breaking' the computer. Since then I've gone from class to class, project to project, job to job, with the same sense of wonder, freedom, and power. I am very happy to be in this field, and aim to use this fabulous toolkit to create a strong positive impact.
