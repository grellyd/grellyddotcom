## Self-Introduction

I write software for a living, and so unlike Debbie, I am quite logical and squential. I am reaching a point in my career where my position gives me to the opportunity to inform, influence, and assist my peers.

Generally, I've always enjoyed writing, but I've never been that great at writing fiction. Where I have started to find my groove is in more technical writing and essay writing.

Looking to learn to write more effectively and empathetically so that I can better communicate to my peers on topics which I am experienced and educated.
 - Informing our customer base on the complicated technical background of the product my team owns
 - Introducing our team to a new Development process
 - A 'how-to' guide on Writing Effective Self-Review content
 - Deep technical dives and explainers on technical topics

 Topics I'd like to learn:
  - Formalise my writing process
  - Defining what 'effective' writing means
  - Balancing between being verbose and concise


 ## Notes

 The more we write, the better we get!
