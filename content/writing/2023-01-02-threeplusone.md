Welcome to the 3+1 development cycle!

This is a quick primer to set you expectations for the month ahead.

## Who

The ULG team. This development cycle change is limited to just the ULG team at this time. If this goes well, it could easily be expanded to other development and tech org teams.

## What

A **4 week** development cycle composed of **one planning and retro week** and **three work weeks**. 

## When

Now! The first planning week starts January 3rd, with the first full cycle starting January 6th completing January 27th. This is directly followed by the next planning and retro week (Jan 30th - Feb 3rd) for the second work period (Feb 6th - Feb 24th).

| Week | Focus |
------ | ----- |
| Jan 3rd | Planning |
| Jan 9th | Work |
| Jan 16th | Work |
| Jan 23rd | Work | 
| Jan 30th | Planning |
| Feb 6th | Work |
| ... | ... |

## How

### Planning week

At the end of the planning week you should know:
 1. The most important topics to work on.
 2. The scope of a successful three week iteration.
 3. An idea of what external resources you will need.

This week is also the time to run a retro on the previous cycle if needed.

**Remember: 3 weeks is very short.** Whatever you choose to do, work to keep it within the cycle.

### Example: The Provisioning Team

Something that has worked for the Provisioning team in the past is two meetings, each up to an hour long:

 1. Objectives & Priorities (Tuesday)
    - This goal of the meeting is to find our main focus(es) for the upcoming cycle. 
    - Without going into specific details, what matters the most right now? Are our priorities from last cycle still our top priorities for this cycle?
    - This can be thought of a 'big rocks' we need to focus on. Like with chipping away at a large stone, we do not need to resolve these topics in a cycle; sometimes it is sufficient to just move them meaningfully along.
    - Managers and folks with input into the roadmap should be present here.
 2. Scope & Detail (Thursday)
    - This meeting focuses on taking our main focuses from the previous chat and figuring out what three weeks of work on them looks like.
    - What is a reasonable scope of work for each high level priority? What does 'done' look like at the end of the cycle?
    - What is the minimum viable deliverable to be successful this cycle? How can we get there?
    - The acceptance criteria defined here will map directly to acceptance criteria in issues and subsequent MRs.
    - What are we going to do? What are we explicitly not doing? What are some stretch goals?

### Work weeks

Execute on your planned work! You should know at a high level what you are doing, and what done looks like. Identify the individual issues and tasks that bring us closer to done and make it happen. Read, write, investigate, code, test, MR, monitor, repeat!

In the last week, look to have everything in MR by Wednesday at the latest. That leaves a two day buffer to review, test, fix get everything through before the end of the cycle. 

If completing the work inside the cycle isn't possible, take some time in a retro to figure out why. Did you have an over-expansive scope of work? Were you waiting on external stakeholders that couldn't deliver on time? Or did life just get in the way? Bring the incomplete work forward into the planning meetings and decide if it is still a priority to get done. If it is, bring it forward to the next cycle. If not, leave it behind.

## Why

Pace! The ULG dream enables us to borrow who and what we need from the different teams under our umbrella. This only becomes possible if there are natural points at which folks can move between projects.

The goal here is **not** to enforce working method compliance. You and your comrades should still pick, scope, design, and execute on the work as before. The goal is to align working periods.

# Questions?

That makes sense! Bring them up in #team-ulg and let's figure them out together. Your manager is a great resource if you need to chat privately. 

With the holidays this first cycle will probably be a bit of a mess, but that is okay. Progress, not perfection.
