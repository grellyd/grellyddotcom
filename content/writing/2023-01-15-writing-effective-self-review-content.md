# Writing Effective Self-Review Content

I recently had a good chat with someone on our team on how to write their self-review, and I learned I had some thoughts and resources that could be valuable to share. 

<aside>
⚠️ These are my personal thoughts based on doing this a few times and chatting with my peers and mentors. Your milage may vary. Your manager may disagree. This may not work for you. However I feel these thoughts are hard earned and valuable to share, especially for those folks who are going through this for the first time.

The first section talks about money. If you don’t like talking about money, skip ahead to 'Your manager is not omniscient'.

</aside>

### The blunt context

We are here for money. Passion for our customers and problem space alongside alignment with our company’s path and priorities help make everything go smoother, but the reality is we would probably not work here if we didn’t get paid. And, broadly speaking, the more you get paid the more you benefit.

With that in mind, there are two ways to earn more: get a raise, and get promoted. Who helps you with that? Your manager and your manager’s manager. In other words, through the review process, you are helping your manager and your manager’s manager understand why you are so valuable to this company and why you deserve to get paid more and potentially get promoted. 

Therefore everything you put in your self-review should be working to show off your value through quantifying your efforts and their impacts. 

### 0,1,2 conversations

At 1Password we do not talk about your value and compensation in the same conversation, and I quite like this. This is beneficial as it allows us to talk about impact and value, without getting whiplash spinning over to the ‘well how much is that worth?’ conversation on each item. 

 - The zeroth conversation is your self-review alongside the review your manager will write up on you. 

 - The first conversation is one where you go over the two and discuss how they align or differ.

 - The second conversation is one of compensation.

While they are distinct conversations, one absolutely informs the other. Demonstrating your impact and value in your self-review arms you to get your manager onboard with how amazing you are, which in turn helps the second conversation go well.

### Your manager is not omniscient

As much as I wish my manager saw and understood the value of everything that I created and impacted this year, that simply isn’t the case. It is entirely infeasible for them to see everything all their direct reports do, and understand its value. They will hopefully have a good sense of your impact on the whole, but that isn’t enough: they need to be able to defend to their manager and team why you deserve a certain raise or a promotion.

In other words, you need to help fill in the blanks and flesh out the reasons why their good sense of you is correct, or perhaps not high enough. If I can make my manager go “Oh wow, I didn’t realise you did all of that” or “that was more involved and impactful than I understood”, I know I have succeeded.

### STAR answers

One powerful tool to show off your value is through [STAR answers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result). Commonly used during interviews, they also have their place in self-reviews. These are answers that fully illuminate the:

- **Situation** - What were you looking to achieve? What was the goal?
- **Task** - What was your role in the situation?
- **Action** - What did you do?
- **Results** - What was the outcome?

A good STAR answer fully demonstrates the context, how you fit into that context, what you actually did, and the subsequent impacts. 

To me, a good metaphor is viewing a painting: the situation is the background of the piece, the task the subject of the painting, the action way in which it is composed, and the result the emotion it conveys. Leaving any part out bars a viewer from being able to effectively interpret the piece. 

The same is true for your self-review answers: failing to provide adequate context, clarity on your role, details of what you did, or the resulting outcomes impairs your manager from being able to effectively interpret your win and its impact. In turn, that hampers your manager from being able to represent why you are deserving of the highest raise or that next promotion.

While explaining your wins over the last year, read with a critical eye: have you painted a full picture?

### Beyond a resume for work

Do you remember how before applying for this job you had to write your resume and for each previous role, you had to explain your impact and outcomes in that role? However you had to reduce the breadth of your experience to pithy little statements that do not reveal sensitive information?

This is exactly the same, except you are able to write more than a single line and use internal data and resources to back up your statements. These are powerful tools that allow you to demonstrate far more than you ever could on your resume. 

How to reinforce your answers? Links to internal resources are a great start. That super difficult epic you delivered? Link to it. That shiny new documentation page you wrote? Link to it. That heart-warming piece of customer feedback? Link to it. The more effective evidence you can present, the better. 

Another way to reinforce your answers is to leverage action verbs. These are strong verbs that clearly communicate what you did. “Initiated and delivered the project” is far better than “worked on the project”. I have had to work hard to shake off passive language in my writing; you probably will have to as well. To help, try using an action verb sheet. I’ve included my favourite below, from [MIT's Career, Advising, and Professional Development centre](https://capd.mit.edu/). Simply reviewing your writing with one eye on this sheet goes a long way.

In all of it, try to remain concise and brief. Volume of words or links does not necessarily mean a stronger point. Be selective in what you write down. Remember, you are aiming to effectively communicate. They have to read the thing after all.

### Final thoughts

This is hard. Remembering everything you did and then being able to talk about it eloquently is hard. Give yourself time and space to think, process, write, reflect, and review. This gets a bit easier with practice and experience, but it is never easy.

A tool that can help next time around is building a brag document throughout the year. I quite like what [Julia Evans has to say on the topic](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/). Think of this as partly a running tally of your accomplishments, and partly a goal journal. Next time you have to do this exercise, refer back to your brag document for inspiration. 

Good luck!
