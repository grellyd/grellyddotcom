These are my class notes for the **_Principles, Process, and Pleasure of Writing_** class I am taking with Deborah Schnitzer and Amanda Le Rougetel, through their organisation [_Writing as a Tool for Transformation_](https://www.writingastool.ca/)

The class is described as:

> Experience the joy of becoming the writer you want to be. Join us for an exploration of writing—from elements of style to foundational principles of composition and forms of revision. 
>
> A big part of what makes writing pleasurable is being able to bend language and structure to our command, because we know what we are doing and why we're doing it. Bring your interest in writing and in reading, your joy of language and your questions, as we dive into the writer’s sandbox of principles and processes. 
>
> In a creative and generative way, you will respond to existing texts and compose your own. Whether your goal is pleasure or publication, this course is open to writers of any genre or subject matter.

These notes are fairly haphazard and incomplete. However they offer quite a few of my in-progress writing samples, responses to in-class prompts, and homework assignments.

# Notes

## Class 1

### Self-Introduction

I write software for a living, and so unlike Debbie, I am quite logical and sequential. I am reaching a point in my career where my position gives me to the opportunity to inform, influence, and assist my peers.

Generally, I've always enjoyed writing, but I've never been that great at writing fiction. Where I have started to find my groove is in more technical writing and essay writing.

Looking to learn to write more effectively and empathetically so that I can better communicate to my peers on topics which I am experienced and educated.

 - Informing our customer base on the complicated technical background of the product my team owns 
  - Introducing our team to a new Development process
 - A 'how-to' guide on Writing Effective Self-Review content
 - Deep technical dives and explainers on technical topics

 Topics I'd like to learn:
 
  - Formalise my writing process
  - Defining what 'effective' writing means
  - Balancing between being verbose and concise


 A note: The more we write, the better we get!


 ### Writing Life - Anchor Words

 - Who do you write for? 
    - Myself primarily, peers, friends, folks I mentor. I'd love to write for the wider world, but that doesn't seem real
 - Where do you do your writing? 
    - In familiar but different places
 - When do you write? 
    - Just in time, as needed
 - How do you write/what tools do you use? 
    - Digital tools, a minimal text editor (NVim)
 - What do you write? 
    - Technical, process, and personal explainers and meditations
 - Why do you write?
    - To clarify thoughts in my own head, to inform, to influence, and most of all, to assist.
 - How do you begin? How do you revise? How do you finish? 
    - Begin? Bullet points. Revise? Reading out loud. Finish? When it is above the bar I set and been peer-reviewed at least once.
 What advice would you give someone about writing? - Cut out words that are not needed - aim for clarity over beautiful text

  - At this time, on this day, and this time, how do you describe your writing process? 
    - Haphazard yet logical. I rarely start with a structure, but one arises as I drill deep into my thoughts for clarity. I strive to find the natural organisation in my mind and bring that onto the page so that someone may effectively understand, digest, and appreciate what I am working to share. 

 - Outline your writing practice:
    - The practice starts when I identify a need where those I care about may benefit from my knowledge and experience. Through conversation and internal interrogation, I find my thoughts and their foundations, and put them on the page with a structure that reveals itself. The practice ends when each piece is complete, and is resurrected when the next need arises. 

 - Can you describe your writing philosophy? What is it about writing? Why does it animate you? Why do you feel you have something to say? What motivates you?
    - I write to learn. To help others learn what I've worked to find out. It is thrilling to see my thoughts reveal themselves on the page with their natural organisation and clear thoughts. While I do not define myself as an expert, I believe I have enough of value to make sharing worthwhile. Beyond learning and helping, bluntly being a better communicator that can inform, influence, and assist others across boundaries will enable me to unlock the next step in my career progression.

### Protrait of the artist

I write to learn. I write to help others learn what I've worked to find out. I write to clarify thoughts in my own head, to inform, to influence, and most of all, to assist.
 
It is thrilling to see my thoughts reveal themselves on the page with their natural organisation and clarity of purpose. While I do not define myself as an expert, I believe I have enough of value to make sharing worthwhile. Beyond learning and helping, bluntly being a better communicator that can inform, influence, and assist others across boundaries will enable me to unlock the next step in my career progression.  My writing practice starts when I identify a need where those I care about may benefit from my knowledge and experience. Through conversation and internal interrogation, I find my thoughts and their foundations, and put them on the page with a structure that reveals itself. The practice ends when each piece is complete, and is resurrected when the next need arises. 

How do I begin? Through bullet points. How do I revise? Through reading out loud. How do I finish? When my work is barely over the bar I set, and been peer-reviewed at least once. Bullet points enable me to dive to the heart of the matter, reading out loud breaks me away from my inner monologue, and peer-review freezes my imposter syndrome out in the cold. I strive for clarity in my writing, to the point I would be thoroughly satisfied with a series of bullet points if they were crystal clear and completely encapsulated my thought. In that vein, while reviewing I aim to cut our words that are not needed; I aim for clarity and brevity over beautiful text. Sparse writing enables interesting words to walk to the forefront.

Defining an artistic self-portrait is an uncomfortable exercise, as I do not see myself as an artist; it feels uncomfortable as it gives credit where none is yet due, and renown where none has yet been found. I write, I create, I conjure into being, but the label does not yet feel earned. Yet.

## Class 2

### Re-writing for another audience: 

Who is the audience of the homework? My super-ego.

Take the portrait, translate it as an author bio as a national literary magazine. 250 max

> Graham is a writer who creates in order to clarify, to inform, to influence, and most of all, to assist himself and others. On topics he has knowledge and experience to share, he writes short to medium length essays, technical deep-dives, and how-to guides. Through conversation and internal interrogation, he finds his thoughts and their foundations, he moves them on to the page with an intuitive structure. Graham strives for clarity in his writing, to the point that he would be thoroughly satisfied with a series of bullet points if they were crystal clear and fully encapsulated the ideas at hand. His sparse writing style enables interesting word choice to shine, while still delivering clarity and brevity.


This feels more like formal professional writing. Communication, not entertainment is the goal. Play does not exist.

### Profiling

 - Fear re audience: That no one cares. To put something out into the ether that I slaved over and think is excellent, but no one cares
 - Who is your Reader: Younger version of myself that needs a bit of help and support. I write that which I wish I could have read once upon a time.
 - Can you characterise your ideal reader? Ditto ^^. Younger me looking to solve problems older me has once encountered.
 - As the writer, what kinds of choices would you make to meet their needs and expectations? Assuming little to no prior knowledge. Explaining from nearly first principles, to provide a foundation upon which to build. The building can rise quickly, but the path upwards must be clear.


Once upon a time, I needed help and advice. Lacking any sense of wisdom, I turned to Charles Bukowski, an utter rogue. While he was the worst devil of almost every vice, his insights were true and clear and the perfect place to start.

### Homework

Using your anchor words from earlier in Tuesday’s class as ‘data’, write a text about your relationship as writer to AUDIENCE. Feel free to expand on the anchor words.

 - Consider your fears, desires, hopes, expectations, etc.
 - 350 words — no fewer than; more if you need them
 - Bring this text to Class No. 3 on February 7th, as we will work with it.

> I write for myself. For myself now, myself tomorrow, and myself years ago. Those three require different time and attention in order to be effectively communicated with.
>
> For myself today, I write as I wish to read now; I take a firm clear approach to the issue at hand and define it from first principles with a keen eye to detail and completeness. For the future self I write with context; I ensure to describe my reason for writing and how the conclusion was reached, eyeing how well it was received with any applicable outcomes. For the past self, I teach so those without my current knowledge may follow; I strive for clarity while documenting the steps that build to my conclusions.
>
> Concerns regarding my audience extend to those that don’t fit within those three roles, aka anyone else. I know that if I slave away over a piece of writing, my past, present, and future self will appreciate it. I fear that no one else will. I believe this fear is mostly unfounded, as my work has already found decent value, praise, and acclaim. However one cannot prove a negative. I suppose the question then becomes: what is enough validation after which my fear is proven unfounded? Not yet, but I do not think such a point is beyond reach. 
>
> I hope that others will derive as much if not more value than I got from learning and writing about the topic. I believe this I can deliver.

## Class 3 - Editing

What are two words that come to mind when we say: Edit your Work?

__Before:__
- Me: reading aloud
- All: Tedious, revisit, cut out, improve, decision, repeat, whittle, re-read enjoy, clean up the hot mess, streamline, almost no more UFOs (unfinished objects), epiphanies, reading aloud, work.

__After:__
- Me: iterate and restructure
- All: Clarify, question, exploration, consistency, find those UFOs, creativity, carve, immersion, choices, iterate and restructure, hope, add subtract, space, rethink

Flash-length creative non-fiction or fiction - under 100 words
Micro CNF/F - under 250 words

Write without fear, edit without mercy. Kill all your darlings. To write is human, to edit is divine.

### In-class exercise:

__Opening paragraphs__
> “Twenty-one years ago, when my wife, Margaret, and I first moved up to the country from New York City and bought an eighteenthcentury farmhouse in Pleasant Valley, New York, not far from Poughkeepsie, we didn’t give much thought to our new neighbours, who were mostly hardworking dairy farmers of seventeenth-century Dutch or English stock and, while not exactly unfriendly, were reluctant to enter into conversation with people who didn’t raise Holsteins and weren’t interested in the price of milk.”


Country Matters by Michael Korda. (2001). New York City: Harper Collins.


> “Back in 1961, when women wore shirtwaist dresses and joined garden clubs and drove legions of children around in seatbeltless cars without giving it a second thought; back before anyone knew there’d even be a sixties movement, much less one that its participants would spend the next sixty years chronicling; back when the big wars were over and the secret wars had just begun and people were starting to think fresh and believe everything was possible, the thirty-year-old mother of Madeleine Zott rose before dawn every morning and felt certain of just one thing: her life was over.  
>
> Despite that certainty, she made her way to the lab to pack her daughter’s lunch.”


Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus. (2022). Penguin Random House. 

__Three-word sentence__

> The boy jumped

The young tired boy jumped, again and again. Up and down, up and down, with the only audible accompaniment the rasp of his breath and the thwack of the rope.
