Since I’m applying to a developer position, I want to know what languages/frameworks 1Password usually works with - any must haves?

Take a peek at this blog post: https://blog.1password.com/internship-what-its-like/

I think the biggest thing especially in terms of finding the first internship is showing interest. you generally dont have a lot of relevant experience and neither do first year/second year courses really show relevant experience

but i think the biggest thing is showing a desire to learn and gain those experiences through interest

whether that be going to hackathons, sideprojects or whatever - showing interest is important in the scope of a first internship

and i think if you center your resume around that it helps
