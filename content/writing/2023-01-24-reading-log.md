# Reading Log

## Week One

### Cory Doctorow - [Plura-list] Podcasts are hearteningly enshittification resistant

> Podcasting is an open technology built out of open technologies. We have damned few of those left. The openness of podcasts once allowed wild experimentation, with new kinds of audio made by new kinds of creators finding new kinds of audiences.
>
> The drive to enshittify, unfettered by regulation or competition, has allowed many of the world’s largest, stupidest tech companies to unhinge their jaws and tempt podcast makers and listeners to traipse blithely onto their slathering tongues. They were *always* going to snap their jaws shut eventually - just because Spotify lacked the executive function to wait for a fully ripened enshittification before biting down, it doesn’t mean we’re out of the woods.

Leveraging taboo-breaking language. "Enshittification". 

### Patrick McKenzie (patio11) - KYC and AML: beyond the acronyms 

> And this is the first important non-intuitive thing about KYC and AML regimes: the goal is not to achieve banks having good knowledge of their customers or to prevent money laundering. It is to stochastically manage crime and terrorism at the margins by requiring an oft-unrecognized policy arm, the financial industry, to implement their own stochastic management of their books of business.
>
> A particular important realization is that KYC and AML don’t have to be effective in their own terms to contribute to these goals. That is a bit mindblowing, but let’s come back to it after we talk a bit about their own terms.

Effective, clean, and clear language.

## Week Two

### Ben Thompson - The Four Horsemen of the Tech Recession (Stratechery Article 2-6-2023)

> Remember, though, that tech didn’t just survive COVID: it thrived. Consumers with no way to spend discretionary income and flush with stimulus checks bought new devices; people stuck at home subscribed to streaming services and ordered e-commerce; businesses thrust into remote work subscribed to SaaS services that promised to make the experience bearable; and all of this ran on the cloud.

Good use of punctuation including semicolons.

### The Narwhal - Dereliction of doodie: Ontario’s plans for York Region’s sewage could hurt Great Lakes — and U.S. relations

> “There comes a time in every climate reporter’s life when you’ve gone through the studies, the development plans, the regulations … eventually you’ll hit a pile of crap.” 

Great hook line! This was from the email notification on the publishing of the article. I clicked because _I had to_ find out what the pile of crap was all about.

### Ramit Sethi The Rich Life - What you can learn from these bad “Shark Tank” pitches

> Who doesn’t like the smell of bacon in the morning? 
>
> What? I have to spend eight hours sleeping next to a piece of raw bacon, and then have an oven start up right by my head while I’m sleeping? 
>
> What could go wrong? 
>
> But the next pitch makes the BBQ candle and Wake ‘N Bacon seem like billion-dollar ideas.

Almost naught but questions! Quite fun.
