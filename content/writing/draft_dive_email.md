To the Bonaire Dive shops:


Hi,

Weâ€™re looking for some information on a do-it-yourself dive package for May 2024. 

We are a group of five(?) divers from Canada looking to come to Bonaire for a dive vacation in May 2024. We are all experienced cold water divers of varying certification levels (PADI Advanced Open Water up to PADI Instructor) and are looking to rent tanks, weights, and get air and NITROX fills. We will be flying in with the remainder of our dive gear.

Is your shop able to help us arrange these rentals and fills? What costs would we be looking at? 

Thanks,

Graham
