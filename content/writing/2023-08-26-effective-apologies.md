What are the essential components of an apology? In my view:

1. Take responsibility and state that you are sorry. Don’t dance around it. Be blunt. Apologize. “I apologize”
2. Be specific what you are apologizing for. “I acknowledge our failure to attend promptly to your cat caused their condition to worsen. Our triage protocols failed to indicate the severity of your cat’s condition.”
3. Show empathy. Demonstrate you understand how your action impacted the person you are apologizing to. “Coming to our clinic for help and then being forced to wait must have been immensely stressful and hard to bear. You showed immense grace acting as calmly as you did”
4. Determine how this error can be avoided in the future and state corrective actions you are or will take. How are you going to manage the situation the next time it occurs? “Due to your experience and complaint, we are updating our triage protocols and retraining our staff to ensure cases like yours are correctly triaged in the future. 

You can then reiterate some elements and conclude. “I apologize again on behalf of our clinic. We are glad to hear your fluffy friend is doing better. We hope you will consider allowing us to serve you again in the future.”

An effective apology can be practically magic for the giver and the recover
