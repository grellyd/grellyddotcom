You, a technical contributor, just got asked to do your first behavioural interview. Neat! That’s career progression. Helping with interviews and building your team are great ways to grow your knowledge and experience. Plus sitting on the other side of the table can be fun, and is almost always informative. 

But now what do you do? How do you prepare? How do you start? What do you ask? What are you looking for? How do you decide on your rating?

Great questions. Let’s dive in.

<aside>These thoughts come from my experience doing a number of behavioural interviews plus interviews of other types. The post was prompted by providing mentorship and advice to some newer interviewers. The advice seemed sound, so here we are. </aside>

## Preparation

A good interviewer is prepared. Coming in with a smile, calm confidence, and being comfortable in the (virtual) room sends a strong positive indicator to the candidate. There is nothing like a poorly prepared interviewer to give a candidate a poor impression of the company, potentially losing you an excellent hire. Plus it doesn’t take too long at all. The more interviews you do, the shorter time you will need. 

How does one prepare? By familiarizing yourself with the role you are hiring for, the key indicators your hiring team are looking for, the candidate themselves, and what questions you intend to ask. To do so, you should:

 - Read the job description. What are you publicly requesting a candidate will be like? What skills will they have, and what interpersonal qualities do you need? Are there any strict requirements?
    - Ideally, the candidate will have most if not all of the requested attributes. Your hiring team should do most of the screening to get to the point where your time is needed to dive in. Don’t worry if they don’t exactly fit. 
    - This is a behavioural interview, so not everything applies. 
 - Read any relevant internal hiring guides or chat with the hiring manager. What signal are they most looking to get out of this interview?
    - This is not the only interview they are going through. There are other signals coming from the technical rounds, the project retrospective round, etc. 
    - You are probably not the decision maker on if this person gets hired. What does that decision maker most want to know?
 - The candidate’s resume and cover letter (if one exists). What relevant experiences do they have? What was their most recent role?
