You, a technical contributor, just got asked to do your first behavioural interview. Neat! That’s career progression. Helping with interviews and building your team are great ways to grow your knowledge and experience. Plus sitting on the other side of the table can be fun, and is almost always informative. 

But now what do you do? How do you prepare? How do you start? What do you ask? What are you looking for? How do you decide on your rating?

Great questions. Let’s dive in.

<aside>These thoughts come from my experience doing a number of behavioural interviews plus interviews of other types. The post was prompted by providing mentorship and advice to some newer interviewers. The advice seemed sound, so here we are. </aside>

## Preparation

A good interviewer is prepared. Coming in with a smile, calm confidence, and being comfortable in the (virtual) room sends a strong positive indicator to the candidate. There is nothing like a poorly prepared interviewer to give a candidate a poor impression of the company, potentially losing you an excellent hire. Plus it doesn’t take too long at all. The more interviews you do, the shorter time you will need. 

How does one prepare? By familiarizing yourself with the role you are hiring for, the key indicators your hiring team are looking for, the candidate themselves, and what questions you intend to ask. To do so, you should:

 - Read the job description. What are you publicly requesting a candidate will be like? What skills will they have, and what interpersonal qualities do you need? Are there any strict requirements?
    - Ideally, the candidate will have most if not all of the requested attributes. Your hiring team should do most of the screening to get to the point where your time is needed to dive in. Don’t worry if they don’t exactly fit. 
    - This is a behavioural interview, so not everything applies. 
 - Read any relevant internal hiring guides or chat with the hiring manager. What signal are they most looking to get out of this interview?
    - This is not the only interview they are going through. There are other signals coming from the technical rounds, the project retrospective round, etc. 
    - You are probably not the decision maker on if this person gets hired. What does that decision maker most want to know?
 - The candidate’s resume and cover letter (if one exists). What relevant experiences do they have? What was their most recent role? What do you find most interesting/compelling about their work?
 -  What questions you intend to ask. We’ll dig into this a bit later, but based on what you have learned so far about the role, the signals your hiring team are looking for, the candidate’s background, what do you want to know more about? What needs further detailing and reinforcement? What is missing that you wish you saw?

 Once your preparation is complete, get your space presentable, make yourself presentable, and practice your introduction if you need.
 
 ## The introduction
 
I’m a firm believer that the first five minutes of an interview are essential for correctly setting the tone, expectations, and overall vibe. As the person leading the interview, you should firmly take charge of the room, set expectations clearly, and get buy-in from the interviewee. 

To accomplish these goals, my go-to introduction protocol is to:
 - Join slightly early to be the first one there (alternatively, have the Zoom call start when you join/waiting room enabled)
 - Smile say hello and welcome the person by name
 - Clearly set time expectations. “We have x minutes together today. I will work to leave you y minutes at the end to ask whatever questions you have.”
 - Clearly set content expectations. “This is a behavioural interview, so I’ll be asking you questions on your past experiences, how you approached problems, and how you work with others.”
 - Clearly set an agenda. “I’ll give you a little introduction about myself, and then ask you to do the same. After that there are some questions I have to ask, but we can otherwise see where the conversation takes us.”
 - Confirm understanding and get buy in: “How does that sound? Any questions?”
 - Give any other warnings/caveats before you start.
 
In full, that will sound something like:

> Hi Alice, and welcome. I’m Graham and today we’ll be conducting a behavioural interview for the Senior Developer position on the User Lifecycle & Growth team. We have 50 minutes together today, and I’ll work to leave least ten minutes at the end for you to ask whatever questions you have. I’ll start with a little introduction on who I am and what I do for 1Password, then get you to tell me a little bit about yourself. After I have a few questions I need to ask, but otherwise we can see where the conversation takes us. How does that sound?

(After they say yes/ask questions)

> Great. One caveat before we get started: I’ll be taking notes throughout our conversation, so if you see me staring off to the side, I’m just looking an external monitor. My keyboard can be a bit loud, so please let me know if it is distracting, and I’d be happy to mute myself. 

### Tell me about yourself

This is a question most folks hate, with good reason: they don’t know how to answer it. 

I actually quite like it: it give you the opportunity to reveal interesting pertinent information alongside foundational facts plus tidbits of humanizing information.

As an interviewer, I attempt to lead by example and give my “tell me about yourself” response and then ask them to do the same, demonstrating the types of information I want to hear from them. 

As an interviewer, mine sounds something like this:

> Let me tell me a little bit about myself. My official title is a “Tech Lead on the Admin Onboarding and Provisioning team, operating under the User Lifecycle & Growth umbrella. What do all those words mean? I primarily care for our business administrators’ first 60 days with 1Password, enabling them to bring their tens if not hundreds of thousands of users into 1Password, tailor the 1Password Business experience to fit their needs and constraints, and otherwise set up their organization for long term success. As a tech lead, I provide technical leadership for my team, guidance and mentoring to our more junior developers, and dig in and solve some of our hardest problems. I’ve been at 1Password for just over four years, and I’ve watch the org go from just over a hundred employees to now just over a thousand.
